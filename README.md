# DatabaseCompare
This is a desktop based project. I developed using C#,MSSQL,ADO.Net and XML.

Basically, Its comparing databases as physcally. It means the comparing about table name, columns name, data types,data length, data order, indexes, constraints, procedures, functions.

When run the program, first you need to add 2 connections. The connections can be local to server, local to local and server to server. You can add quick comparation. it means you can save your connections with a name. You can edit or delete quick comparation and your connections from edit menu.
